# Dinoflagellate Intron Evolution

This repository harbors data and documented scripts corresponding to the analyses conducted in the following manuscript:


**Scott William Roy, Landen Gozashti, Bradley A. Bowser and Brooke N. Weinstein, Graham E. Larue (2020). Massive intron gain in the most intron-rich eukaryotes is driven by introner transposable elements of unprecedented diversity and flexibility. BioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.339549**


### Ancestral intron reconstruction

The folder, `intron_models`, contains the alignment files and phylogenetic tree file to reproduce the ancestral intron reconstruction in the paper using the graphical user interface in [Malin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~csuros/introns/malin/) along with results from the analyses.


### Introner element families

The folder, `ILEs`, contains fasta files of sequences for each ILE family in each considered species, and scripts used to identify them. The folder also includes a script to construct consensus sequences for ILEs, along with consensus sequences for each ILE family and candidate ILE sequences found in intergenic regions.
