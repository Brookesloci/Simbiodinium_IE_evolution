# Dinoflagellate Intron Evolution

This repository harbors data and documented scripts corresponding to the analyses conducted in the following manuscript:


** Scott William Roy, Landen Gozashti, Bradley A. Bowser and Brooke N. Weinstein, Graham E. Larue (2020). Massive intron gain in the most intron-rich eukaryotes is driven by introner transposable elements of unprecedented diversity and flexibility **

This repository contains the alignment files and phylogenetic tree file to reproduce the ancestral intron reconstruction in the paper using the graphical user interface in [Malin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~csuros/introns/malin/) along with results from the analyses.
